CamML:
CamML is an Android application designed to assist visually impaired users in understanding their surroundings. By leveraging the device's camera and machine learning capabilities, CamML provides real-time object detection and environmental feedback. The application also supports voice-based interactions, enabling users to provide specific prompts and receive audio feedback for a seamless, hands-free experience.

Features:
üîç Real-Time Environment Identification
Utilizes the device's camera to detect objects, people, and environmental elements.
Provides meaningful and descriptive audio feedback to the user.
üé§ Voice Interaction (Speech-to-Text)
Users can provide prompts to ask specific questions about their environment.
Hands-free operation for ease of use.
üîä Audio Feedback (Text-to-Speech)
Converts the detected information into speech for user accessibility.
Ensures clear and concise communication tailored to user needs.
ü§ñ Machine Learning Integration
Powered by cutting-edge machine learning models for accurate detection.
Efficient processing to deliver results in real time.

How It Works:
Camera Activation: The app uses the device's camera to capture the environment in real time.
Object Detection: Machine learning models analyze the camera feed to identify objects and contextual elements.
Voice Input: Users can ask questions or provide prompts via speech, which are converted to text using speech-to-text technology.
Audio Feedback: The app conveys the detected information or responds to the user's query via text-to-speech.

Permissions Required:
Camera: To capture the environment in real time.
Microphone: To enable speech-to-text functionality.
Storage (Optional): To save logs or configurations.
Usage
Launch the application.
Point the camera toward the environment.
Speak a prompt (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in front of me?‚Äù or ‚ÄúIs there a chair nearby?‚Äù).
Listen to the app‚Äôs audio response describing the detected objects or answering your prompt.
Technologies Used
Kotlin: Application development.
Google Speech-to-Text API: For voice input handling.
Android Text-to-Speech: For delivering audio feedback.
