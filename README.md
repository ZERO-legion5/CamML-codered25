## Overview
**CamML** is an innovative tool designed to enhance the user experience by capturing and interpreting the user's environment. The application uses advanced AI models to detect objects, recognize text, and navigate the surroundings based on prompts provided by the user. The outputs are presented in a speech-to-speech manner, ensuring seamless interaction.

## Features

### Core Functionalities:
1. **Object Detection:**
   - Identifies and describes objects in the user's surroundings.
   
2. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):**
   - Extracts and reads textual information from images or the environment.
   
3. **Navigation:**
   - Provides navigation guidance based on user prompts and environmental data.

### Additional Features:
- **Language Support:**
  - Supports multiple languages for a broader user base.
- **Chat History:**
  - Retains interaction logs for reference.
- **Hands-Free Control:**
  - Operates via physical buttons on the mobile handset or a Bluetooth headset.
- **Battery Optimization:**
  - Reduces image movement to save power.
